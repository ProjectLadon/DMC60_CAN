# Startup Sequence
The first thing this node does is attempt to enumerate the devices attached to the CAN bus.

After enumeration is complete, this module shall set the parameters on each hardware device as described in the parameters section.

If all enumerated devices have unique device numbers, they will be published (and start accepting commands) immediately upon enumeration.

# Topics
All topics use the device number as the motor ID. Therefore, the structure of topic names is ``/<node_name>/<motor_id>/<topic_name>`` or ``/<node_name>/<motor_id>/<category_name>/<topic_name>``.

## Subscribed Topics

# Services
These services correspond to vendor commands for manipulating the device.

## get_dev_list
Returns a list of the enumerated devices and session ids, in JSON format
```
bool dummy
---
bool success
string dev_list
uint8 error
```

## set_dev_number
Sets the device number of the device with the given device number or session number to the given value. If the session_id and old_dev_id do not name the same device, the session_id takes precedence. If the new device id is already in use, this service will fail. Old publications and subscriptions are deleted and re-made for the new device ID.
```
uint8 old_dev_id
uint8 session_id
uint8 new_dev_id
---
bool success
uint8 new_dev_id
uint8 error
```

## get_descriptors
Returns the device descriptors of the identified device. If the device id is non-zero, it will query the device with that id; otherwise it will use the session id.
```
uint8 dev_id
uint16 session_id
---
bool success
uint8 error
string dev_name
string mfg_name
string prod_name
string mfg_date
string hardware_version
string serial_num
```

## flash_leds
Flashes the LEDs in a rainbow pattern for five seconds.
```
uint8 dev_id
uint16 session_id
---
bool success
uint8 error
```

## reset
Perform a software reset
```
uint8 dev_id
uint16 session_id
---
bool success
uint8 error
```

# Parameters
Parameters may be set on a per-device basis or for all devices connected to the node. If the parameter name is used as shown, then it will apply to all devices not otherwise specified. Parameters may be specified on a per-device basis by appending ``_<dev_num>`` to the parameter name.

If these parameters exist on startup, this node will set them on the target hardware after startup enumeration and when the device number changes. Note that not all parameters available on the device are defined here. See DMC60C CAN Protocol Guide for more information on the format of each one. Note that conversions from ordinary floats to the fixed point versions used by the protocol are handled internally.
